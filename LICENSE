The Totally Chill MIT License (MIT)

> **Note**:Note: Yep, we initially picked a license that wasn’t as user-friendly as we hoped. So, here we are, upgrading to the MIT License, because sharing is caring — and coding is better without strings attached.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person grabbing a copy of this code and all related files (the
“Software”), to rock it, remix it, and roll it out however they want — including, but not limited to, the rights to use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, and even sell copies of it — without hassle.

All we ask is you give a little shoutout by including the copyright notice above and this permission notice in all
copies or substantial chunks of the Software, because credit where credit’s due, right?

No Warranty, No Problem This Software is provided "AS IS", without any kind of promise or warranty. That means no
guarantees of any sort — not even that it won’t fry your computer or lead you down a road to coding madness. If
something goes wrong, it’s on you. In no event shall the authors be liable for any harm, bugs, or bizarre behavior
arising from using this Software. So, use it wisely (or not)!

Happy coding, and go make something awesome!
